# DeepSea

DeepSea is a customized [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness)
(DSH): a fork of the harness kept as topic branches over its releases
([taliesinb/deepsea-harness](https://github.com/taliesinb/deepsea-harness)),
plus the plugins, the native macOS app and the developer tools in this
repository. Nearly every feature is a plugin; the fork changes the harness
only where no plugin seam exists.

It is a personal setup, developed in the open: macOS first, moving quickly,
with no stability promises.

## Trying it

You need macOS with the Command Line Tools (`swiftc`), Node 22.19+ or 24+,
and pnpm 11. The harness lives in its own repository beside this one
(`harness.lock` names it as `../deepsea-harness`, with the commit pinned):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/taliesinb/deepsea.git
git clone https://github.com/taliesinb/deepsea-harness.git
cd deepsea
node tools/dsd/bin/dsd.mjs link    # build the pinned harness commit, link ./harness to it
node tools/dsd/bin/dsd.mjs play    # the app with every plugin and simulated providers
```

On a fresh Mac, [tools/bootstrap.sh](tools/bootstrap.sh) does all of this
and more: the Command Line Tools, Node and pnpm (no administrator access
needed), both clones in `~/ds`, the harness build and an installed DeepSea
in the Dock. It is safe to run again, and `--help` lists its options:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taliesinb/deepsea/topic/base/tools/bootstrap.sh -o bootstrap.sh
bash bootstrap.sh
```

`dsd play` starts a throwaway: its own home, server and app, every model
provider simulated with test accounts and a scripted model (type `help` as a
prompt), removed when you quit the app. No keys or accounts are needed.
Installing a variant you keep, and everything else `dsd` does, is in
[tools/dsd/README.md](tools/dsd/README.md).

On Linux, `dsd` installs and runs variants as servers (no app): its relay as
a systemd user unit, reached from another machine's DeepSea, a browser or
the Linux thin client in `apps/linux`. What it needs there, an official Node
build and a C compiler among them, is in the Linux section of
[tools/dsd/README.md](tools/dsd/README.md#linux).

## Branches

| Branch | |
|---|---|
| `integration/base` (default) | everything together: `topic/base` with every topic merged |
| `topic/base` | the baseline: `dsd`, the shared packages, the conventions |
| `topic/<name>` | one feature or one tight cluster of plugins, based on `topic/base` |

The harness repository is arranged the same way: `topic/base` over the
upstream release, its topics listed in [topics.txt](topics.txt), and
`integration/<release>` merging them. Topic and integration branches are
rebased and rebuilt as the work moves; see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

software and are kept apart from this repository; `dsd` finds them when they
are present ([LAYOUT.md](LAYOUT.md) §3).
