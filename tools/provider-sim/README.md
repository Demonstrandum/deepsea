# tools/provider-sim — simulated model providers

A loopback HTTP server that stands in for model providers, so DeepSea can be
tested end to end (models, routes, billing, sign-in) without real accounts.
It runs no inference: replies are scripted exactly as with the scripted model
(`packages/script`: JSONL commands, or the plain prompts `say <text>` and
`help`), but put on the wire in each provider's own protocol, and every
request is charged to an account that keeps real-looking credit, balance and
usage.

## How DeepSea reaches it

The harness baseline redirects every model provider's host when
`DSH_PROVIDER_SIMULATOR` names a loopback URL (`provider-simulation.ts` in
`@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm`): `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` becomes
`<simulator>/openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`. Everything else in the stack (the
provider SDKs inside pi-ai, DeepSeek's own adapter, billing's account reads)
runs unchanged. A provider the simulator does not serve answers 501, so a
simulated home never reaches a real service.

```sh
dsd run release --throwaway-app --simulated                      # openrouter + deepseek test accounts
dsd run release --throwaway-app --simulated --accounts openrouter-low,deepseek-empty
dsd run release --throwaway-app --simulated --accounts openrouter=sk-or-mine   # a persistent account
dsd run release --throwaway-app --simulated --accounts anthropic,anthropic-max  # API key and a signed-in Plan
dsd sim status | start | stop | accounts [<provider>] | fixtures
dsd sim account openrouter sk-or-mine --set '{"usageMicros": 0}'
dsd sim account anthropic max@example.com --set '{"plan": "max20"}'      # an email: a Plan account
```

`--simulated` starts the simulator if it is not running (one per machine and
macOS account, left running; `dsd sim stop` ends it), creates the throwaway's
accounts, puts their keys in the server's environment and the routes they
need in its profile patch, and sets `DSH_PROVIDER_SIMULATOR`.

## Accounts

An account is created the first time a credential is used: any API-key
string, or an email address signed in through a simulated sign-in page (kind
`email`). New key accounts start with $10 of credit or balance. Money is kept
in micro-dollars and spent at the model's catalog prices (pi-ai's generated
catalog, the same one DeepSea uses), from the script's `usage` command or an
estimate of four characters per token.

`fixtures/<provider>.json` name starting points (`dsd sim fixtures` lists them all): each has a provider, a credential,
the environment variable the key goes in, the rows its route needs, and a
starting state. A throwaway gets fresh accounts, its id appended to each
credential (before the `@` of an email: `max+3275dd@example.com`), so no two
throwaways share one; `name=<credential>` uses that credential as it is, for
an account that persists across runs.

A sign-in fixture (`kind: email`, `signIn: <route>`) starts the throwaway signed in, without a browser: dsd asks the simulator for tokens (`POST /_sim/sign-in`) and writes the grant pi-ai would have stored after a browser sign-in into the throwaway's `.credentials.yaml` (credentials-local's record `llm-pi-ai/<route>`: `{ type: oauth, access, refresh, expires }`). A throwaway holds one sign-in per route.

The store is `~/.deepsea/_sim/sim.sqlite` (SQLite in WAL mode, every change in
an immediate transaction, so several simulators or tools can share it);
`~/.deepsea/_sim/sim.json` records the running simulator, and its run logs are
in the machine log directory's `sim/`.

## Providers

One module and one document each, in `providers/`, with the test accounts in
`fixtures/<name>.json`:

| Provider | Hosts | Fixtures |
|---|---|---|
| [OpenRouter](providers/openrouter.md) | `openrouter.ai` | `openrouter`, `openrouter-low`, `openrouter-empty` |
| [DeepSeek](providers/deepseek.md) | `api.deepseek.com` | `deepseek`, `deepseek-empty` |
| [Anthropic](providers/anthropic.md), API key and Plan | `api.anthropic.com`, `claude.ai`, `platform.claude.com` | `anthropic`, `anthropic-low`, `anthropic-max`, `anthropic-max-80` |

Both wire formats stream (server-sent events) or answer whole, with text,
reasoning, tool calls and usage. A script plays across a turn as with the
scripted model: one response per request, counted by the assistant messages
since the prompt (the user message that starts the turn; context the harness
adds after it is ignored). `expect` checks the tool results the request
carries; `error` answers the HTTP status of its kind (with `Retry-After`), and
with `times` only for its first attempts. The harness's own side requests
are answered as the scripted model answers them, never by replaying the
session's script (which would play, and charge, its turn again): the session
titler's request gets the script's `title` (else "scripted session"), and a
compaction request gets "Summary: a simulated session."

The simulator's own endpoints are under `/_sim/`: `status`, `accounts`
(`?provider=`), `POST account` (`{ provider, kind, credential, state }`
creates an account or merges `state` into it; `kind` is `key` or `email`), and
`POST sign-in` (`{ provider, email, plan?, accessSeconds? }`: the account,
created if new, and fresh tokens, as the provider's token endpoint answers),
for providers with a Plan sign-in.

## Adding a provider

1. List every endpoint DeepSea's stack calls for it: pi-ai's provider code
   (`dist/api/*.js`, `dist/auth/oauth/*.js` and the `*.models.js` catalogs
   under the harness build's `packages/llm/llm-pi-ai/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai/`),
   the harness's adapters and sign-in flows (`packages/llm/`), and billing's
   account reads (`plugins/billing`).
2. Write `providers/<name>.mjs` (see `providers/index.mjs` for its exports;
   `common.mjs`'s `generate()` plays the script in the OpenAI or Anthropic
   wire format; `wire.mjs` for others), answering exactly those endpoints in
   the provider's own shapes and errors, and `providers/<name>.md`.
3. Add `fixtures/<name>.json`: a key fixture names the environment variable
   the route reads its key from (`env`) and the rows the route needs
   (`settings`); a Plan fixture names its route (`signIn`).
4. Test it in `tests/<name>.test.mjs`, then in a `--simulated` throwaway with
   the plugins that use it (billing, login).

## Tests

`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`. dsd's own tests provision a Plan fixture and
check the credentials document it writes.

## Not simulated yet

Each provider's document lists its gaps. Across providers: a conversation
whose last turn failed after a tool call reads a new prompt as the old
turn's continuation (the tool result and the prompt arrive in one user
message): start a new session for the next script.
