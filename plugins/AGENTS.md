# AGENTS.md — plugins

One directory per plugin, each an installable npm package. Names follow
[LAYOUT.md](../LAYOUT.md) §1: directory `plugins/<name>`, package
`@deepsea/<name>`, loader row id `deepsea-<name>`.

## A plugin directory

```
plugins/<name>/
  package.json        name, dsh.bundle.patch (and dsh.client for a browser half), scripts
  cordis.patch.yml    the bundle row(s) this package inserts when installed; at least one
                      row is named after the package (dsd loads the plugin through it)
  index.js            host half (Node): apply(ctx, config)
  src/client/         browser half, if any (TypeScript/TSX)
  build.mjs           builds lib/client.js (esbuild)
  tests/              node:test, run by `pnpm test`
  README.md           what it does, configuration, how it works, limits
```

The harness topics a plugin needs are declared in its package.json,
`"deepsea": { "requires": ["<harness topic>", …] }`; `dsd topics` reads them.

Dependencies on the harness are `link:` devDependencies through the
`harness` link (`link:../../harness/packages/...`), for types and tests only.

## Names

Every name a plugin puts into a namespace it shares with the harness or
with other plugins carries a DeepSea prefix, so it can never collide with an
upstream name and can be found by searching for `deepsea`. Plugin names
leave out implementation suffixes (`-command`, `-tool`, `-status`): the
plugin is called after what it does (`login`, `billing`, `reboot`).

| Namespace | Form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Plugin directory, package, loader row | `plugins/<name>`, `@deepsea/<name>`, `deepsea-<name>` | `plugins/reboot`, `@deepsea/reboot`, `deepsea-reboot` |
| Cordis plugin `name` export | the loader row id | `deepsea-reboot` |
| Services a plugin provides (`ctx.provide`) | `deepsea<Feature>` | `deepseaBilling` |
| Fetch routes (`ctx.connection.fetch`, under `/api`) | `/api/deepsea-<name>/…` | `/api/deepsea-billing/snapshot` |
| Web server routes (outside `/api`) | `/deepsea-<name>/…` | `/deepsea-test-driver/health` |
| HTTP headers of our own | `x-deepsea-<name>[-…]` | `x-deepsea-tailscale` |
| CSS classes, DOM ids, `data-*` attributes | `deepsea-<name>-…`, `data-deepsea-…` | `deepsea-billing-pill` |
| Page globals | `__DEEPSEA_<NAME>__` | `__DEEPSEA_APP__` |
| Browser storage keys, `Symbol.for` keys | `deepsea.<name>.<key>` | `deepsea.billing.dismissed` |
| Config schema `vendor` | the loader row id | `deepsea-billing` |

Names the model or the person sees keep their meaning and stay as they are:
tool names (`list_dir`, `wait`), slash commands (`/reboot`), setting labels.

Contracts between plugins, so plugins ported separately agree:

| Contract | Provided by | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| service `deepseaBilling` (session snapshots) | `billing` | (tests) |
| service `deepseaTailscaleRelay` (relay status, restart) | `tailscale` | `reboot` |
| service `deepseaSessionOwners` (which login drives which session) | `tailscale` | `billing` |
| service `deepseaRemoteWorkspaces` (remote session rows) | `remote-workspaces` (browser half) | `numbered-switching` |
| headers `x-deepsea-tailscale: 1`, `x-deepsea-tailscale-self: 1` on proxied requests | `tailscale` | `import-sessions` |
| header `X-DeepSea-Forward-Error` (loopback forward refusals) | `tailscale` | the macOS app |
| attribute `data-deepsea-remote-session` on remote session rows | `remote-workspaces` | `numbered-switching` |

A plugin that uses a contract whose provider is not ported yet keeps the use
(optional, as before) under the new name. `dialog-keys.ts` (Enter presses a
dialog's default button) is copied into each plugin with a dialog; keep the
copies identical.

## Host half

- Register through `ctx` (tools, commands, Fetch routes, listeners); wrap
  anything Cordis does not manage in `ctx.effect(() => … return dispose)`.
- `inject` names required services; an optional one is reached with
  `ctx.inject([name], callback)` or `ctx.get(name)`.
- Export a `Config` schema; invalid configuration fails the load before
  `apply` runs. A later patch layer replaces a row's whole `config`.
- Host module edits need a server restart; module-source hot reload is off.
- Log with `ctx.logger` (`info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`). The harness keeps
  no log sink after startup; `plugins/server-log` writes the messages to the
  server's standard error, which `dsd` captures into the throwaway's server
  log (`dsd run` loads it into every throwaway).
- State goes under `$DSH_HOME/plugins/<name>/`, traces and logs under the
  variant's log directory (LAYOUT.md §4-5), scratch under
  `$TMPDIR/deepsea-<name>-…`.
- Logs and traces go through `@deepsea/logs` (`packages/logs`; dependency
  `"@deepsea/logs": "link:../../packages/logs"`): `createTrace` for an
  optional JSONL trace (configured with `trace: true`), `openRunLog` for a
  log per run or per child process, `pluginLogDirectory` for anything else.
  Never copy its code into a plugin.
- **Machine-wide plugins.** A plugin that acts on something outside its
  variant (a browser it drives, local model servers it starts and stops, a
  Tailscale Serve path, a licensed external program) declares it in
  package.json: `"deepsea": { "machineWide": "<what it controls>" }`.
  `dsd run … --plugins all` leaves such plugins out of throwaway variants
  (naming one includes it), so a throwaway never acts on a resource a real
  variant is using.
- Fetch routes (`ctx.connection.fetch.register`) sit behind DSH's own
  authentication; a state-changing route takes POST with a JSON body so a
  cross-site form cannot reach it without a CORS preflight.

## Browser half

- Declared by `{ "dsh": { "client": { "platform": "web" } } }` and the
  `./client` export (`lib/client.js`); the bundle must exist when the server
  starts.
- The bundle is a CJS module wrapped in
  `window.__ModuleLoader__.load({ id: '<package name>', factory })`. Only the
  shell's platform modules stay external: `react`, `react/jsx-runtime`,
  `react-dom`, `react-dom/client`, `@deepseek-ai/cordis`,
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-store`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-slots`,
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives`. Everything else is inlined.
  Mirror: `harness/packages/client/web/src/platform.ts`.
- Runtime imports of other `@deepseek-ai/*` client packages are forbidden;
  `import type {}` is how slot declarations are pulled in.
- UI is contributed through slots (`ctx.slots.inject(name, () =>
  ctx.slots.register(...))`); components never see `ctx`. Reference:
  `harness/docs/subsystems/slots.md`.
- Rebuilding `lib/client.js` hot-swaps every browser running the plugin.

## Testing

- `pnpm test` (node:test) for host logic and pure client helpers;
  `pnpm typecheck` against the linked harness packages.
- Exercise a plugin in a throwaway: `dsd run release --throwaway-server
  --scripted --plugins <name>` (tools/dsd/README.md), never in the instance
  the user is working in. With `--scripted` every prompt is a JSONL script
  of the model's exact reply, so turns, tool calls and their UI can be
  tested without an API key (plugins/scripted-model/README.md). Drive it
  from the shell with `dsd drive` (create-session, prompt, command, events;
  plugins/test-driver/README.md) rather than through a browser. For a
  browser half, use `--throwaway-app`: the real macOS app, hidden, driven
  with `dsd drive` (wait-page, click, type, eval, describe, snapshot) or a
  `dsd script` (tools/dsd/README.md), so what you check is what the person
  sees.
