# AGENTS.md — plugins

One directory per plugin, each an installable npm package. Names follow
[LAYOUT.md](../LAYOUT.md) §1: directory `plugins/<name>`, package
`@deepsea/<name>`, loader row id `deepsea-<name>`.

## A plugin directory

```
plugins/<name>/
  package.json        name, dsh.bundle.patch (and dsh.client for a browser half), scripts
  cordis.patch.yml    the bundle row(s) this package inserts when installed; at least one
                      row is named after the package (dsd loads the plugin through it)
  index.js            host half (Node): apply(ctx, config)
  src/client/         browser half, if any (TypeScript/TSX)
  build.mjs           builds lib/client.js (esbuild)
  tests/              node:test, run by `pnpm test`
  README.md           what it does, configuration, how it works, limits
```

The harness topics a plugin needs are declared in its package.json,
`"deepsea": { "requires": ["<harness topic>", …] }`; `dsd topics` reads them.

Dependencies on the harness are `link:` devDependencies through the
`harness` link (`link:../../harness/packages/...`), for types and tests only.

## Names

Every name a plugin puts into a namespace it shares with the harness or
with other plugins carries a DeepSea prefix, so it can never collide with an
upstream name and can be found by searching for `deepsea`. Plugin names
leave out implementation suffixes (`-command`, `-tool`, `-status`): the
plugin is called after what it does (`login`, `billing`, `reboot`).

| Namespace | Form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Plugin directory, package, loader row | `plugins/<name>`, `@deepsea/<name>`, `deepsea-<name>` | `plugins/reboot`, `@deepsea/reboot`, `deepsea-reboot` |
| Cordis plugin `name` export | the loader row id | `deepsea-reboot` |
| Services a plugin provides (`ctx.provide`) | `deepsea<Feature>` | `deepseaBilling` |
| Fetch routes (`ctx.connection.fetch`, under `/api`) | `/api/deepsea-<name>/…` | `/api/deepsea-billing/snapshot` |
| Web server routes (outside `/api`) | `/deepsea-<name>/…` | `/deepsea-test-driver/health` |
| HTTP headers of our own | `x-deepsea-<name>[-…]` | `x-deepsea-tailscale` |
| CSS classes, DOM ids, `data-*` attributes | `deepsea-<name>-…`, `data-deepsea-…` | `deepsea-billing-pill` |
| Page globals | `__DEEPSEA_<NAME>__` | `__DEEPSEA_APP__` |
| Browser storage keys, `Symbol.for` keys | `deepsea.<name>.<key>` | `deepsea.billing.dismissed` |
| Config schema `vendor` | the loader row id | `deepsea-billing` |

Names the model or the person sees keep their meaning and stay as they are:
tool names (`list_dir`, `wait`), slash commands (`/reboot`), setting labels.

Contracts between plugins, so plugins ported separately agree:

| Contract | Provided by | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| service `deepseaBilling` (session snapshots) | `billing` | (tests) |
| environment `DEEPSEA_RELAY` (the URL of the relay that started this server; absent without one) | the relay (`apps/relay`) | `reboot`, `backup-restore`, `tailscale` |
| service `deepseaSessionOwners` (which login drives which session) | `tailscale` | `billing` |
| service `deepseaRemoteWorkspaces` (remote session rows) | `remote-workspaces` (browser half) | `numbered-switching` |
| headers `x-deepsea-tailscale: 1`, `x-deepsea-tailscale-self: 1`, `x-deepsea-tailscale-admitted: user\|cookie\|public`, `x-deepsea-tailscale-login: <login>` on proxied requests | `tailscale` | `import-sessions` (the first two); the plugin itself |
| header `x-deepsea-relay: starting\|failed` on the relay's 503 while `dsh web` starts | the relay | the macOS app (shows the relay's page), `reboot` |
| route `<serve path>/api/deepsea-tailscale/loopback-forward?port=<n>` (WebSocket) and its refusal header `X-DeepSea-Forward-Error` | `tailscale` | the macOS app |
| attribute `data-deepsea-remote-session` on remote session rows | `remote-workspaces` | `numbered-switching` |
| page global `__DEEPSEA_SESSION_TITLE_SLUG__` (`{ parseSlug }`) | `session-title-slug` | `remote-workspaces` (slug previews on its New Session rows) |

A plugin that uses a contract whose provider is not ported yet keeps the use
(optional, as before) under the new name. `dialog-keys.ts` (Enter presses a
dialog's default button) is copied into each plugin with a dialog; keep the
copies identical.

## Host half

- Register through `ctx` (tools, commands, Fetch routes, listeners); wrap
  anything Cordis does not manage in `ctx.effect(() => … return dispose)`.
- `inject` names required services; an optional one is reached with
  `ctx.inject([name], callback)` or `ctx.get(name)`.
- Export a `Config` schema; invalid configuration fails the load before
  `apply` runs. A later patch layer replaces a row's whole `config`.
- Host module edits need a server restart; module-source hot reload is off.
- Log with `ctx.logger` (`info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`). The harness keeps
  no log sink after startup; `plugins/server-log` writes the messages to the
  server's standard error, which `dsd` captures into the throwaway's server
  log (`dsd run` loads it into every throwaway). Rows load concurrently, so a
  message logged while the server starts, before server-log is active, can
  be lost; check startup work by its effect.
- State goes under `$DSH_HOME/plugins/<name>/`, traces and logs under the
  variant's log directory (LAYOUT.md §4-5), scratch under
  `$TMPDIR/deepsea-<name>-…`.
- Logs and traces go through `@deepsea/logs` (`packages/logs`; dependency
  `"@deepsea/logs": "link:../../packages/logs"`): `createTrace` for an
  optional JSONL trace (configured with `trace: true`), `openRunLog` for a
  log per run or per child process, `pluginLogDirectory` for anything else.
  Never copy its code into a plugin.
- **Machine-wide plugins.** A plugin that acts on something outside its
  variant (a browser it drives, local model servers it starts and stops, a
  Tailscale Serve path, a licensed external program) declares it in
  package.json: `"deepsea": { "machineWide": "<what it controls>" }`.
  `dsd run … --plugins all` leaves such plugins out of throwaway variants
  (naming one includes it), so a throwaway never acts on a resource a real
  variant is using.
- Fetch routes (`ctx.connection.fetch.register`) sit behind DSH's own
  authentication; a state-changing route takes POST with a JSON body so a
  cross-site form cannot reach it without a CORS preflight.

## Browser half

- Declared by `{ "dsh": { "client": { "platform": "web" } } }` and the
  `./client` export (`lib/client.js`); the bundle must exist when the server
  starts.
- The bundle is a CJS module wrapped in
  `window.__ModuleLoader__.load({ id: '<package name>', factory })`. Only the
  shell's platform modules stay external: `react`, `react/jsx-runtime`,
  `react-dom`, `react-dom/client`, `@deepseek-ai/cordis`,
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-store`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-slots`,
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives`. Everything else is inlined.
  Mirror: `harness/packages/client/web/src/platform.ts`.
- Runtime imports of other `@deepseek-ai/*` client packages are forbidden;
  `import type {}` is how slot declarations are pulled in.
- UI is contributed through slots (`ctx.slots.inject(name, () =>
  ctx.slots.register(...))`); components never see `ctx`. Reference:
  `harness/docs/subsystems/slots.md`.
- Rebuilding `lib/client.js` hot-swaps every browser running the plugin.

## Testing

- `pnpm test` (node:test) for host logic and pure client helpers;
  `pnpm typecheck` against the linked harness packages.
- Exercise a plugin in a throwaway: `dsd run release --throwaway-server
  --scripted --plugins <name>` (tools/dsd/README.md), never in the instance
  the user is working in. With `--scripted` every prompt is a JSONL script
  of the model's exact reply, so turns, tool calls and their UI can be
  tested without an API key (plugins/scripted-model/README.md). Drive it
  from the shell with `dsd drive` (create-session, prompt, command, events;
  plugins/test-driver/README.md) rather than through a browser. For a
  browser half, use `--throwaway-app`: the real macOS app, hidden, driven
  with `dsd drive` (wait-page, click, type, eval, describe, snapshot) or a
  `dsd script` (tools/dsd/README.md), so what you check is what the person
  sees. For anything that depends on the server going away and coming back
  (`/reboot`, `/restore`, a cold start), use `--throwaway`: the same app
  behind a relay, as an installed variant runs; `dsd logs <id> server
  --follow` shows each start.
- Anything that touches model providers (routes, the model picker, sign-in,
  keys, billing, quotas, errors from a provider) is tested with
  `--simulated` (tools/provider-sim/README.md): every provider is replaced
  by the local simulator, with test accounts that keep credit, balance and
  usage, and the same scripts. Real accounts are used only by the user, or
  with their go-ahead.
- Before calling a topic done, check it beside the others: `dsd topics
  check` (conflicts) and, after `dsd topics integrate`, a throwaway from
  `--source integration/base --plugins all`.
