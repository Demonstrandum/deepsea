# @deepsea/login

Sign-ins to provider plans and other browser (OAuth) sign-ins, from the chat
and from the Models page. llm-pi-ai registers each flow with
`ctx.authorization`: plans (Anthropic Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT/Codex, GitHub
Copilot, …) and pay-per-use OAuth (OpenRouter, …).

```text
/login FLOW [oauth]            start a sign-in; its route appears once it is authorized
/login                         the flows offering a sign-in (= /logins available)
/logout FLOW                   delete a stored sign-in
/logins [list]                 flows whose sign-in is stored
/logins available [STRING]     flows offering a sign-in, optionally filtered
/logins pending                attempts in flight
/logins cancel [FLOW]          withdraw one or every pending attempt
```

Each command shows its result in the plugin's own chat card, where a sign-in
link is one click.

## Pickers and placeholders

- A bare `/login` (Enter on it, or picking it from the slash menu) opens a
  searchable picker of the sign-in flows: the route's name (`Anthropic Plan`,
  `OpenRouter OAuth`), the flow name, and `signed in` on the active ones. A
  flow offering several methods gets one row per method (every pi-ai flow
  has one, `oauth`). The pick runs `/login <flow>` like a typed line, card
  included.
- A bare `/logout` opens the same picker over the active sign-ins only.
- After `/login ` and `/logout ` the composer placeholder lists the flow names
  (`[anthropic, github-copilot, …] [oauth]`): the ones registered when the
  plugin loads, else pi-ai 0.87.1's set (`KNOWN_FLOWS`).
- Both pickers read `GET /api/deepsea-login/flows` (name, label, route, kind,
  vendor, methods, active, pending; no secrets) each time they open. They are
  `ctx.commandUi` decorations: typed arguments still go straight to the host
  command. DSH's command system has no as-you-type completion for arguments,
  so the picker is where the names are offered.

## Add login (Settings → Models → Plans)

The Plans section of the Models page ends in an **Add login** button (the
`settings.models.section-actions` seat, key `plans`; absent on a harness
without it). Its dialog:

- lists the plan sign-ins (flows whose route llm-pi-ai classifies as
  `subscription`: Anthropic, GitHub Copilot, Kimi For Coding, Meta, OpenAI
  Codex, xAI) by vendor, marking the signed-in ones; pay-per-use OAuth flows
  (OpenRouter, Radius) are not plans and are left to `/login`;
- starts the same attempt `/login` would (`POST /api/deepsea-login/start`; a
  pending one is reused), and answers the flow's own questions inline: a
  choice (Codex: browser or device code) as buttons, a text field (Copilot:
  Enterprise domain) as an input;
- shows **Authorize in browser** with the short URL beside it
  (`claude.ai/oauth/authorize`), plus the device code when there is one. Both
  are real links: a new tab in a browser, `open` through the DeepSea app's
  `__DEEPSEA_APP__.openExternal`. Nothing opens by itself;
- polls `GET /api/deepsea-login/status?flow=` every second while pending
  ("Waiting for authorization…"), then shows "Signed in as <email>" (the
  account from `llm.describeSignIn`), the error, or "Sign-in cancelled" with
  Back / Try again;
- **Cancel** (and closing the dialog) cancels the attempt
  (`POST /api/deepsea-login/cancel`), which also frees the flow's callback
  port.

All routes sit behind DSH's own authentication; the POSTs require a JSON
body, so a cross-site form cannot reach them without a CORS preflight the
server never answers.

## Opening the sign-in page

- When `/login` returns a sign-in URL, typed (`command/executed`, emitted only
  to the client that ran it) or picked, the browser half opens it in the
  user's own browser: the DeepSea app's `__DEEPSEA_APP__.openExternal`
  (native, no click needed; also from a framed remote session through
  `window.top`), else `window.open` in a new tab, which a browser may block
  if the Enter that ran the command is too long ago.
- The card says "If the sign-in page didn't open, click this link: …", and
  its link opens in the user's browser too: the card wraps its Markdown in
  its own `MarkdownDelegateProvider`, so the chat's link setting (default:
  the sidebar browser) does not apply. A sign-in page needs the browser
  holding the provider session, and its redirect goes to a loopback
  callback.
- **Remote servers are not handled yet.** pi-ai's loopback flows redirect to
  `http://localhost:<port>/callback` (Anthropic: 53692) on the machine
  running the server. When the app shows another machine's server, the
  browser is on this machine, so that port must be forwarded to the server
  before the redirect; the app's loopback port forwarding could do it, keyed
  on the `redirect_uri` in the sign-in URL, but nothing triggers it yet.
  Until then the device-code and paste-the-code fallbacks are the way.

## Requirements

Harness topics `pi-ai-oauth-routes` (llm-pi-ai keeps each OAuth sign-in on
its own route: provider `X` gets a route `X-oauth` with its grant at the
credential key `llm-pi-ai/X-oauth`, separate from route `X` and its API key)
and, for Add login, `settings-models-signins`. Without the first, this plugin
lists no flows.

## Behaviour

- **Flow names** are the credential keys without the `llm-pi-ai/` scope and
  the `-oauth` suffix: `/login anthropic` authorizes `anthropic-oauth`.
- **Plan or not** is llm-pi-ai's call, not this plugin's: it classifies each
  `-oauth` route from pi-ai's `isSubscription`, so the route is called
  `Anthropic Plan` in the model picker and billing, but OpenRouter's sign-in
  (which issues a pay-per-use key) `OpenRouter OAuth`.
- **The route appears with the sign-in.** Once a sign-in is authorized, its
  route is added as an empty profile through `ctx.settings`, in the form
  namespace llm-pi-ai reports for it (`listConfigurableProviders()` →
  `settingsNs`, `settingsPath`): the same write the Models page makes,
  persisted in the profile's `cordis.patch.yml`. A sign-in in progress,
  cancelled or failed adds nothing, so it shows no provider in the model
  picker or on the Models page. A route that already exists, even as an empty
  profile, is reused and never overwritten.
- **The result** is the provider's browser URL as a Markdown link (plus a
  device code when the flow has one). The browser callback completes the
  sign-in; there is no `finish` action. With no URL within 30 s (paused while
  a question is open) the attempt is withdrawn.
- **Prerequisite questions** (account type, domain, login method) are asked
  in the initiating session through `ctx.userQuestions`; nothing is chosen
  automatically. Secret prompts are refused: API keys belong on the Models
  page.
- **`/logout`** deletes the stored sign-in, and the route with it while the
  route is still the empty profile a sign-in added; a route you customized
  stays (without its sign-in). It forgets the sign-in locally and does not
  revoke it at the provider. A Plans card with a red dot therefore means a
  sign-in that exists but is broken: its grant is missing, or the provider
  refused a refresh.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `index.js` | host half: the three commands and the Add login routes (`runLogin`, `runLogout`, `runLogins`, `signInRoutes` are exported for tests) |
| `src/client/index.tsx`, `style.css` | browser half: the keyed `conversation.chat.commandview` card for all three, the `/login` / `/logout` pickers |
| `src/client/plans.tsx` | the Models page's **Add login** button and dialog |
| `src/client/browser.ts` | opening a sign-in page in the user's own browser |
| `build.mjs` | esbuild → `lib/client.js` in the shell's module-loader wrapper |
| `cordis.patch.yml` | bundle patch inserting the `deepsea-login` row |

## Development

```sh
pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test
```

`pnpm install` needs the repository's `harness` link (`dsd link`).
